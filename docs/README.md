# Camille Web Framework

## Overview

Camille's Web Framework - first of the Camille product list.
Inspired by fastapi, cpp-httplib, with a touch of simplicity.
Will never want to write backend application in another languages/framework after finding THIS.

## More Products - Camille

Camille's Web Framework is the first child, but as always i strive for more, therefore there's also:

1. Camille Proxy - Fast, Optimized Proxy, Reverse Proxy, its time to get our own proxy in C++!
2. Camille ORM - ORM That's built right. No more to say.
3. Camille Agenty - C++ LLM Agent Framework, Only for the C++ Community.
4. Camille's Itch - I had an itch to create a DB Proxy for analytics.. no more extensions that are haradcoded in your database.
